fist ddl command
1=create
how to create user
create user ali identified by ali;
we face error so we write below command
alter session set "_oracle_script"=true;
now session altered and we write first command then our user is created
now we connect the user 
conn
enter user_name:ali
enter user_password:1234
it will again give error
ORA-01045: user UMER lacks CREATE SESSION privilege; logon denied
now i will again connect to the admin user or system user and give garnt or access to our user
conn
enter user_name:system
enter user_password:1234
grant connect to ali;
now i give access to new user
now  i can connect to new user
how to drop user
go in system  and run command (drop user cascade;)
we face error then (alter session set "_oracle_script"=true;)
then again (drop user username cascade;) now the user will droped
show user and go in that in which user you want to create table
create table employee (id number(10),name varchar2(20),address varchar2(30));
you face error then go in again system write command alter session set "_oracle_script"=true; and the write command grant all privileges to academy;
and then go in user in which user you want to create table
create table employee (id number(10),name varchar2(20),address varchar2(30));
insertiing data into table 
insert into employee values(1,'Umair Jadoon','Havelian Abbottabad');
for retreving whole data from table
select *from employee;
for deleteing row or record in table(delete employee where id=5;)
for deleting whole table we use drop command(drop table tablename)
if you want to set the displaying table structure use this command(set line 100) youn can change any thing instead of 100
find name and course,contact  from havelian (select name,course,contact from student where address='Havelian';)
if you want to permanent save the table or changes you did in table(commit;)
a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values COMMAND IS(select distinct address from student;).
By using the DISTINCT keyword in a function called COUNT is used for counting, 
we can return the number of different addrresses(select count(distinct address) from student;).
The WHERE clause is used to filter records,it retrevie those who full fll the condition(select name from student where id=1;)
WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!
we can use other operators with where clause(>,<,>=,<=,<>,in,between,like)
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. (select name,course from student where id between 1 and 5; )
To display the  outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:(select name,course from student where id not between 2 and 5;)
